I am a **Software Engineer** writing **Haskell** for [**Hasura**](https://hasura.io/).

**Haskell** is an advanced purely-functional programming language. An open-source product of more than twenty years of cutting-edge research, it allows rapid development of robust, concise, correct software. With strong support for integration with other languages, built-in concurrency and parallelism, debuggers, profilers, rich libraries, and an active community, Haskell makes it easier to produce flexible, maintainable, high-quality software. You can read more about why we chose Haskell [here](https://hasura.io/blog/from-zero-to-hipster-haskell-in-production-97ea99d90c3b/).

**Graphql** is a joy for frontend developers but a nightmare for backend developers, and thatâ€™s where Hasura steps in so you can get a production-grade GraphQL API instantly [without worrying about writing resolvers](https://hasura.io/blog/save-time-and-stop-writing-graphql-resolvers/). You can check out [GrpahQL: The Documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=783ccP__No8), where the GraphQL creators and other early adopters talk about why they created and adopted GraphQL.

Our core product, the **Hasura GraphQL Engine**, makes your data instantly accessible over a GraphQL API, so you can build and ship modern, performant apps and APIs 10x faster. Hasura connects to your databases, REST and GraphQL endpoints, and third-party APIs to provide a unified, connected, real-time, secured GraphQL API for all of your data.

Apart from work, I love **swimming**, **cycling**, playing **badminton**, **volleyball**, and **table tennis**. I also enjoy playing **guitar** and playing PC games, particularly **Valorant**.

I enjoy (almost) all genres of **music**.

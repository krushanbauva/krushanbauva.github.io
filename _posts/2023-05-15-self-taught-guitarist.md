My journey of playing guitar actually started with me wanting to play drums. I was so fascinated with [Matt McGuire](https://www.youtube.com/@mattmcguiredrums)’s drum covers that it was time I started learning an instrument. But because of the lack of accessibility and challenges around portability with the drum kit, I picked up the guitar instead.

I started learning the basics from [Justin Guitar](https://www.justinguitar.com/). Although I call myself a self-taught guitarist, it wouldn’t be fair if I didn’t give him the credit. I mean, he has made it so easy for anyone to start out with the tutorials he has on the web.

Simple, isn’t it? **Yes**, it was, while my playlist mainly contained pop songs. But as soon as I started playing the instrument, my taste in music evolved (for good), while my skills couldn’t keep up.

At this point of writing this post, I can play rhythm guitar decently well (at least, I think so). I want to keep my approach to becoming a better lead guitarist the same. **Play what I like**. And there are some really amazing songs of various difficulty levels which I would like to be able to play at some point in my life.

Listing it down here with the hope that this will help me get more focused on my journey with the instrument and that I won’t get lost trying to play every other amazing song I come across. This is not an exhaustive list, though.
